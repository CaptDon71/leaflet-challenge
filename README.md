**Module 15 Leaflet Challenge**
This project contains two parts. Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization can be found in the directory "Leaflet-Part-1" and can be reviewed by clicking on the Leaflet-Part-1/index.html. Supporting javascript is found within the Leaflet-Part-1/js/ folder.

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data can be found in the directory "Leaflet-Part-2" but is not functional. I attempted to access the GEOJSON directory to add the tetanic plate layer but ran out of time.
